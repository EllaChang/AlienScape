# Newton's 1st Law Simulator
Welcome to Newton's 1st Law Simulator! You'll be sliding down a level icy pathway where the ideal condition is met: there is zero friction.<br/>

Play it on: http://cs.smith.edu/~cs240a-aa/final_project.html<br/>

The game would be hosted shortly. Below is a sneak peek if you don't want to bother downloading everything:<br/>

### How to win:
There is no winning a simulator game.

### How to not die:
1. Avoid the spinning pillars as you go.
2. Beware! You can't put down either arm if no pillar appears in close enough range. Your arms simply hate being lazy.

### Keyboard Controls:
<pre>
hold 'A'      - put down your left arm<br/>
release 'A'   - put up your left arm<br/>
hold 'D'      - put down your right arm<br/>
release 'D'   - put up your right arm<br/>
</pre>
